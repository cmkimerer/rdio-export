Rdio Export to Google Play Music
================================

Export your Rdio favorites and playlists to Google Play Music.


Requirements:
-------------
 * An Rdio account.
 * A Google Play Music account with an [Unlimited subscription](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3139566).
 * Python on a UNIX-like computer. I use Debian GNU/Linux. A Mac might work.

Google Authentication
---------------------
If you use 2-Step Verification (and you should) then you need to 
[create](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords) an /App password/ rather than using your normal 
Google password.
